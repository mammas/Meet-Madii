								<h2>About Me </h2>

									<p>Native to the deserts of Arizona, hiking and running are two of my most most favorite things to do. 
									I also enjoy playing console and PC games with my family and close friends.
									In the recent years I have taken an interest in programming, and find myself getting involved in many different
									projects. I am currently a student at Arizona State University and am studying Astrophysics, I aspire to earn a 
									PhD and make a discovery someday. I try my best to advocate free software, and that is why this site is written 
									using a creative commons licensed template by <a href="http://html5up.net">HTML5 UP</a>, which I am altering to 
									further my knowledge of HTML5. I am begining my new chapter on Whidbey Island, Washington with my fiance and I 
									cannot be more excited.</p>

									<p>
									Native to the deserts of Arizona, I'm passionate about preserving my environment; my pescatarian lifestyle prompts me
									to eat local or organic foods.
									Tinkering with computers and source code are also among my hobbies, and I find myself getting involved in many different
									projects. I am a student at Arizona State University under an Astrophysics major, where I aspire to earn a
									PhD and work hard towards a significant discovery someday. I advocate for the use of Free(as-in-freedom) software
									and free culture licenses, and that is why this site is written

								<h2>My Skills</h2>
							</header>
							<ul class="features">
								<li class="icon fa-comment">
									<h3>Spanish Speaking</h3>
									<p>Proud of my hispanic heritage, I have been learning Spanish from my grandparents, my school, and work environments for years.
									While working at In-N-Out Burger I was able to take orders and hold light conversations with customers in Spanish, adding to the
									welcoming atmosphere, keeping customers returning. The two years of Spanish I took in high school was of great benefit, and I
									hope to continue honing my speaking and writing skills so I can better immerse myself in the culture my family and home state embraces.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-code">
									<h3>Programming</h3>
									<p>Programming is a recent interest I've eagerly pursued, contributing to projects ranging in platform, skill, and nerdiness.
									While still a novice coder, I have become familiar with languages such as Python, Perl, C++, HTML5 in my studies, hobby, and professions.
									I am a software developer intern at Liquid Web, Inc., a profound web hosting provider with a steady track record.
									All of my projects are Free(as-in-freedom), as a method to let my skills show themselves, most of the projects I contribute
									to are on <a href="http://github.com/mammas">GitHub</a>.
									</p>
								<li class="icon fa-cogs">
									<h3>Work Ethic</h3>
									<p>Being a young adult, the Food Service industry was very attractive as an employment opportunity, which let me gain a
									perspective on the ethics of working well, and being rewarded for it. The fast-paced workload of a bustling burger joint
									conditioned me to work well in a team environment. Working as a lifeguard taught me that work has responsibilities that
									most would disregard. As a Permit-Prep Course Assistant, I invested time into making sure every form was filled and
									filed correctly, so that during the company's yearly audit there were no discrepancies; this taught me compliance with
									the rules and regulations specific to the trade. Now, as a Software Developer Intern, it is my main function to review
									and spot errors in code, requiring a keen attention to detail. Throughout these employments, I devoted the remainder of
									my time to a Air Force Junior ROTC unit, which required daily attention for three years in order to maintain my standing as both a leader
									and my performance as a follower.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-flag-o">
									<h3>Goal Orientated</h3>
									<p>Goal-setting and goal-reaching are the cornerstone characteristics that define and separate me among my peers.
									My intents are made clear, and then procedurally worked on until either my goal is met, or is impossible at that time.
									I set it in my mind to graduate high school early, and so I did, resulting in getting ahead in college.
									Weekly I set goals that allow me to plan how I will self-improve and contribute to my community and projects.
									My hard work awarded me attendance at Arizona State University, where I knocked out most of my core curriculum with a 19-credit
									first semester, rewarded by being placed on the Dean's List. I set goals for myself every day, and never go without accomplishing what I set
									my mind to.</p>
